# neuropixel data preprocessing
scripts for processing data collected during ephys recordings for the 8 port sequence task

# Overview: 
- there are three main data streams (ephys, behaviour and video data)
- each of these need to be processed intially (scripts 1-5)
- then finally these data streams are aligned and a synchronisation file is created=
- these scripts produce processed data in a clean organised file structure
